The day before my birthday we went to Arirang, on the other side of the city right next to Kuudamm. It is not often that I venture over there, but we wanted to go to the Apple Store, have a nice meal and enjoy the sunny day.

The moment we found Arirang, it reminded me of the first time I ever had Korean food. It was in Mexico City, right behind the beautiful avenue of Reforma. The place looked quite run down and we had this dish with black sauce that reminded me of mole. It was absolutely delicious and it is one of my favourite memories. 

I have to say that Arirang didn't disappoint. We had the lunch menu and the food was quite delicious. Even though it was one person for service, he was very nice and didn't make us wait too long. I really did enjoy it and was happy to learn that there is a branch mear my neck of the woods in Friedrichshain.
