My fiancÃ© and I visited a few weeks ago because I had been craving Japanese curry and I saw this TikTok. The place is quite close to us in Friedrichshain, so it was an easy walk to get there.

At the time there was only one other table occupied because of the pandemic.

To order you get a paper form to fill and you can choose among pre-made curries or create your own with the ingredients available.

To drink we had some very nice green tea which had a strong flavour. I ordered a classic curry and my fiancÃ©e made his own with extra veggies and pork. For dessert we had one of their classic Japanese pancakes which was delicious.

Can't wait to go again.
