Cocolo Ramen Xberg has to be one of my favourite places in Berlin. It took me ages to visit it, but once I did it was beyond my expectations.

I had heard of Cocolo XBerg for a very long time. For one reason or another, I don't tend to hangout in Kreuzberg a lot, I ended up changing plans and going to some other places.

It wasn't until our friend moved here that we went there to get a nice bowl of ramen.

At first I got the Shoyu ramen like in the video, but on my birthday this year I got a Tonkotsu ramen and I was in absolute heaven! I really loved it, and I love the atmosphere and how nice the staff is. Price wise, I think it is just right for what you are getting. The taste of the broth, the texture of the noodles, and the toppings are on point every single time we go there.

Usually there is a queue to eat there, but I promise it is very well worth the wait. Now that the pandemic is going on, the queue is pretty much non-existent and the restaurant has taken measures to keep everyone separate while eating.

Sorry I don't have more images, but I often forget to snap because I'm so into the food.
