It is no secret that I have been binging korean dramas and they always show this korean fried chicken franchise which makes me drool every single time.

And the fact that I have been missing chicken wings also contributes to the huge cravings I have for fried chicken. So we went to Kokio on a whim last Thursday with a friend and oh boy, was it glorious!

We got seated right away, chose the menu for 3 people with the three sauces and french fries. My fiancée and our friend had rice wine, and I had a pear juice (thanks antibiotics!). Needless to say we walked out super full and 100% satisfied with the food.

The chicken was cooked to perfection and super crispy, the fries were just right and all the sauces were really tasty. We didn't finish everything because we were so full, so you can bet that the portions were right on point.
